    Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company began to execute significant strategic and management changes to transform our business and adapt to the dynamic retail environment and the evolving needs of our customers in order to position ourselves for long-term success. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company began to execute a comprehensive strategic plan led by our new President and Chief Executive Officer, Sue Gove, who was appointed in October 2022 after serving as Interim Chief Executive Officer. This plan is focused on strengthening the Company's financial position through additional liquidity and a reduction of its cost structure, better serving its customers through merchandising, inventory and customer engagement, and regaining our authority in the Home and Baby markets. To accelerate these strategic initiatives, the Company realigned its organizational structure, which included the creation of Brand President roles for Bed Bath & Beyond and BABY to lead merchandising, planning, brand marketing, site merchandising and stores for each banner.

In conjunction with the Company's new strategic focus areas, the Company executed plans to rebalance its merchandise assortment to align with customer preference by leading with National Brands inventory and introducing new, emerging direct-to-consumer brands. Consequently, we announced the exiting of a third of our Owned Brands, including the discontinuation of three of our nine labels (Haven‚Ñ¢, Wild Sage‚Ñ¢ and Studio 3B‚Ñ¢). We also expect to reduce the breadth and depth of inventory across our six remaining Owned Brands (Simply Essential‚Ñ¢, Nestwell‚Ñ¢, Our Table‚Ñ¢, Squared Away‚Ñ¢, H for Happy‚Ñ¢ and Everhome‚Ñ¢).

Although we moved quickly and effectively to change the assortment and other merchandising and marketing strategies, inventory and in-stock levels were lower than anticipated due to supplier constraints and vendor credit line decreases. This resulted in lower levels of in-stock presentation within the assortments than our customers expect. Consequently, net sales for the three months ended November 26, 2022 were $1.259 billion, a decrease of $618.8 million, or approximately 33.0%, compared with net sales of $1.878 billion for the three months ended November 27, 2021. Net sales for the nine months ended November 26, 2022 were $4.160 billion, a decrease of approximately 28.5% as compared with the nine months ended November 27, 2021.
To right-size our cost structure and store fleet based on lower volumes, we have implemented significant SG&A reductions. Key components of these reductions include:

‚Ä¢Reduction in SG&A by focusing on immediate priorities of merchandising, inventory, and traffic to align with changes in our store footprint, lower Owned Brands development and support, and deferral of longer-term strategic initiatives. Also, we have had a reduction in force, including an approximately 20% reduction across corporate and supply chain associates.
‚Ä¢The planned closure of approximately 150 lower-producing Bed Bath & Beyond banner stores, of which six closed in the quarter.

See further discussion of restructuring and transformation initiative expenses in the "Results of Operations" section herein.

Executive Summary

The following represents a summary of key financial results and related business developments for the periods indicated:
 
‚Ä¢Net sales for the three months ended November 26, 2022 were $1.259 billion, a decrease of approximately 33.0% as compared with the three months ended November 27, 2021. Net sales for the nine months ended November 26, 2022 were $4.160 billion, a decrease of approximately 28.5% as compared with the nine months ended November 27, 2021.
‚Ä¢Comparable Sales* for the three months ended November 26, 2022 decreased by approximately 32.0% compared to a decrease of approximately 7.0% for three months ended November 27, 2021. For the nine months ended November 26, 2022, Comparable Sales decreased by approximately 27.0%. Comparable Sales was not a meaningful metric for the nine months ended November 27, 2021 as a result of the impact of the extended closure of the majority of our stores due to the COVID-19 pandemic during a portion of the comparable period in fiscal 2020.
* See "Results of Operations ‚Äì Net Sales" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for the definition and further information related to Comparable Sales.

‚Ä¢Net loss for the three months ended November 26, 2022 was $393.0 million, or 4.33 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $276.4 million, or $2.78 per diluted share, for the three months ended November 27, 2021. Net loss for the three months ended November 26, 2022 included a net unfavorable impact of $0.68 per diluted share associated with restructuring and other transformation initiatives, and non-cash impairment charges, partially offset by gain on extinguishment of debt of $1.04 per diluted share. Net loss for the three months ended November 27, 2021 included a net unfavorable impact of $2.53 per diluted share associated with non-cash impairment charges, charges associated with restructuring program and transformation initiatives, loss on sale of business, and the impact of recording a valuation allowance against the Company's U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.
‚Ä¢Net loss for the nine months ended November 26, 2022 was $1.117 billion, or $13.40 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $400.5 million, or $3.90 per diluted share, for the nine months ended November 27, 2021. Net loss for the nine months ended November 26, 2022 included a net unfavorable impact of $3.65 per diluted share associated with inventory markdown reserves, restructuring and other transformation initiatives, and non-cash impairment charges, partially offset by gain on extinguishment of debt. Net loss for the nine months ended November 27, 2021 included a net unfavorable impact of $3.74 per diluted share associated with non-cash impairment charges, charges associated with restructuring program and transformation initiatives, loss on sale of business, and loss on extinguishment of debt, and the impact of recording a valuation allowance against the Company's U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.

‚Ä¢In connection with our restructuring and transformation initiatives, during the three and nine months ended November 26, 2022, we recorded total expenses of $54.1 million and $131.4 million, respectively, including $8.6 million and $7.4 million in cost of sales for the three and nine months ended November 26, 2022. In addition, approximately $45.5 million and $123.8 million, respectively, is recorded in restructuring and transformation initiative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations, as well as $100.7 million and $182.9 million, respectively, of impairments.

‚Ä¢During the nine months ended November 26, 2022, we launched Welcome Rewards‚Ñ¢. The Company plans to leverage its recently introduced, cross-banner loyalty program, Welcome Rewards‚Ñ¢ to drive traffic, sales, and customer retention. Welcome Rewards‚Ñ¢ brings valuable savings, more benefits, and special perks to customers who shop online and in stores nationwide at Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, and Harmon. Customers earn and redeem points across the retail banners with every purchase.
uring fiscal 2021, we announced plans to complete our $1 billion three-year repurchase plan by the end of fiscal 2021, which was two years ahead of schedule and resulted in the repurchase of $950.0 million of shares under this plan as of February 26, 2022. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed this program, repurchasing approximately 2.3 million shares of our common stock under the share repurchase plan approved by our Board of Directors, at a total cost of approximately $40.4 million.
Net sales for the three months ended November 26, 2022 were $1.259 billion, a decrease of $618.8 million, or approximately 33.0%, compared with net sales of $1.878 billion for the three months ended November 27, 2021. Net sales for the nine months ended November 26, 2022 were $4.160 billion, a decrease of $1.657 billion, or approximately 28.5%, compared with net sales of $5.816 billion for the nine months ended November 27, 2021. The decrease in net sales for the three and nine months ended November 26, 2022 was predominantly due to the decrease in Comparable Sales driven by lower customer traffic and conversion, in part due to consumer spending patterns and demand, a lack of inventory availability and assortment in key product areas, specifically within the Company's Owned Brands and National Brands product mix.
Sales consummated on a mobile device while physically in a store location and BOPIS orders are recorded as customer facing digital channel sales. Customer orders taken in-store by an associate through The Beyond Store, our proprietary, web-based platform, are recorded as in-store sales. Prior to implementation of BOPIS and contactless Curbside Pickup services, customer orders reserved online and picked up in a store were recorded as in-store sales. Sales originally consummated from customer facing digital channels and subsequently returned in-store are recorded as a reduction of in-store sales. Net sales consummated through digital channels represented approximately 33.0% and 37.0% of our sales for the three and nine months ended November 26, 2022, respectively, compared with approximately 35.1% and 35.8% of our sales for the three and nine months ended November 27, 2021, respectively.
Comparable Sales* for the three and nine months ended November 26, 2022 decreased by approximately 32.0% and 27.0%, respectively. Management attributes a portion of this decline to the impact of lower traffic due to macro-economic factors, such as steep inflation, and fluctuations in purchasing patterns of the consumer. Also contributing to the comparable sales decline was the lack of inventory availability and assortment in key product areas, due to vendor constraints and credit line decreases. Comparable Sales the three months ended November 27, 2021 decreased by approximately 7.0%. For the nine months ended November 27, 2021, Comparable Sales was not a meaningful metric as a result of the impact of the extended closure of the majority of our stores during a portion of the comparable period in fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Comparable Sales normally includes sales consummated through all retail channels that have been operating for twelve full months following the opening period (typically six to eight weeks), excluding the impact of store fleet optimization program. We are an omni-channel retailer with capabilities that allow a customer to use more than one channel when making a purchase, including in-store, online, with a mobile device or through a customer contact center, and have it fulfilled, in most cases, either through in-store customer pickup or by direct shipment to the customer from one of our distribution facilities, stores or vendors.
Sales of domestics merchandise and home furnishings accounted for approximately 36.0% and 64.0% of net sales, respectively, for the three months ended November 26, 2022, and approximately 37.6% and 62.4% of net sales, respectively, for the three months ended November 27, 2021. Sales of domestics merchandise and home furnishings accounted for approximately 36.4% and 63.6% of net sales, respectively, for the nine months ended November 26, 2022, and approximately 38.4% and 61.6% of net sales, respectively, for the nine months ended November 27, 2021.

Based on recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations for the nine months ended November 26, 2022 as well as current cash and liquidity projections, the Company has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this going concern uncertainty.
